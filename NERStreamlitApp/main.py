I know things have been a bit hectic lately, but if you could share the latest draft by Wednesday afternoon, that would be amazing. Also, I had a quick thought about the upcoming client presentation â€” maybe we could brainstorm a few creative visuals during our team check-in tomorrow? Thanks so much for all your hard work lately. Really appreciate it! Best, Taylor"
