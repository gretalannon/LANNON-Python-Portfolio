# LANNON-Python-Portfolio
This repository is for display of my data science portfolio and other notable projects! Will be continually updated as more projects are completed.
Included so far are the following...
## 1. 2023 Baby Names: 
a Streamlit app that allows users to sort through the most popular baby names of 2023. Applications used: Python, Pandas, Streamlit. Project 1 is a fun and basic introduction to the portfolio. It uses core data analysis tools in Pandas demonstrating a funamental understanding of ways to present data. Project one is a demonstration of the difference that can be made by organizing data, even with basic coding tools. With a few functions, an unreadable dataset becomes much more comprehensive and engaging. Link: [Project 1 Repository](basic-streamlit-app)
   
## 2. Tidy Data Project:
Cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data using principles of tidy data. Applications used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib. Project 2 continues on the same theme as project one, now going one step further with data organization. In order to do more complex things with a dataset, it is essential to standardize or "tidy" it. This important distinction between wide and long data is introduced with this project. Project two also offers more visualizations and also pivot tables, to show the different ways you can make data more readable. Visualizations are great for quickly viewing trends, but pivot tables can also be extremely insightful as the dataset can be rearranged to focus in on particular variables.
